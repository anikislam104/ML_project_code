Problem Definition

We wish to work on a project to create a system for diagnosing retinal
illnesses based on machine learning. The project's objective is to use
retinal images to recognize and classify various retinal illnesses, including
age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. A label
identifying the presence or absence of a certain illness will be produced by
the system after receiving an input retinal picture. The goal is to enhance
the precision and accuracy of illness detection and diagnosis, which will
eventually improve patient outcomes.

Dataset

The training dataset consists of 1920 sample images, whereas the test set
and evaluation set both contain 640 sample images.
The three datasets are each accompanied by a CSV file.
